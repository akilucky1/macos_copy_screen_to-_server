# For MacOS sending screenshots to a server using SFTP
## This script will upload any new file in certain directory to a server
Then it will craate link, that will be inserted into a clipboard.

Notification will be shown. 

Original screenshot will be deleted after the upload. 

## Please don't forget to install the modules from PIP
I have automated it through AUTOMATOR app by running this script on startup
